        <p>I am starting my journey to breaking into the design world on my pursuit of web design and UX design. This website is my first attempt and I am excited to create and build this with the help of <a href="https://codecademy.com">Codecademy</a>.</p>

        <p>I started building this site 5 years ago while in school at <a href="https://msu.edu">Michigan State Univeristy</a>. It has been dormant since then, but I have recently found a new enojyment from web design and hope to continue to better my skills. Check back often to see my progress and feel free send any tips or comments to <a href="mailto:hendr141@msu.edu?subject=Web-Design-Encouragement">my email</a>.</p>
